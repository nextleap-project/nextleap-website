The purpose of this workshop is the mobilisation of a core group of researchers and practitioners to investigate the core characteristics of a minimal viable platform for scholarly communication that is researcher-centric, interlinked, and web-native. As visible outcomes, this workshop aims to deliver insights regarding these core characteristics and will determine the most appropriate approach to engage in a sustained effort aimed at tackling technical challenges and promoting adoption of solutions.

The workshop will be held at the [The Web Conf 2018](https://www2018.thewebconf.org/) and host invited talks and research presentations. Giacomo Gilmozzi (IRI) presents the latest development made on the Hypothes.is platform, within the Plaine Commune and NetRights projects.
