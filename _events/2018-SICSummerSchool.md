Following successful SUMSICs in Tilburg and Bologna, this edition will focus on the existing relation between social and public sector innovation at local and regional level, with a strong focus on the role and potential of digital technologies.

During the three-day summer school we will delve in different perspectives, tools, digital platforms, and methodologies that, through several local and regional experiences, networks, case studies, and workshops, help us co-design and co-create new public policies that answer to the key societal challenges in contemporary societies.
